Hello! I'm Yufei, a Ph.D. student in [Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology supervised by [Prof. Danica Kragic](https://www.kth.se/profile/dani). My research focuses on leveraging the strengths of control and planning to provide robots with a robust foundation for learning â€” helping them understand their environment, make informed decisions, and adapt in real time.

Prior to KTH, I obtained my Master degree at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and Bachelor degree with First Class Honours at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). During my master's study, I worked on path planning for fixed-wing UAVs at [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://asl.ethz.ch/) led by [Prof. Roland Siegwart](https://asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.Mjk5ODE=.TGlzdC8yMDI4LDEyMDExMzk5Mjg=.html) and whole-body motion planning for center-articulated robot at [Robotics Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/) led by [Prof. Marco Hutter](https://ethz.ch/staffnet/en/organisation/who-is-who/mavt/details.MTIxOTEx.TGlzdC8xOTEyLC0zNzEzODYwNzI=.html).

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in my work or would like to collaborate!
